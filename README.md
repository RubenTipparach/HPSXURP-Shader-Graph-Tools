# HPSX-URP Shader Tools
This repo is created to help fill the missing gap for URP supported Post Processing and Shader Graph based PSX rendering tools.

This tool set was made possible by code from the URP PSX repo and the LWRP PS1 shaders repo.

There are major modifications made to the Dithering (which did not seem right to me in the original URP volume toolset) and the LWRP PS1 shaders were updated to URP.
